# ADSB_Alert
Experiments with a ADSB warning device

Inspired by MustardTiger on the ExpressLRS discord (see https://github.com/PicoADSB), I'm trying out a simple ADSB receiver using R820T for the tuner and STM32H7 for the processing. The aim is to create a simple portable ADSB monitor that can alert a pilot to close-by traffic.

Current status: Barely started*

\* Barely started is the step just after "twinkle in the eye"
